This is Image Encryption and Decryption project.

Steps to use this project.
1. First run the encrypt script and give it a path of image as input.(I have given some sampples images here)
2.Then Enter key to encrypt.
3.After running the script it will create encrypted image with same file name you have entered.
4.Now run the decrypt and give name of encrypted file and its key.
5.Now you will see the original file after the execution of decrypt script.

Thank You!!!!!!!
